# Recursion

Completed as part of The Odin Project .

Three separate functions were created to satisfy the needs of this [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion). The first 2 return the first 'n' values of the Fibonacci Sequence. One uses iteration, the other recursion. The 3rd function uses merge sort to sort the values of a given array.

Project can be ran by downloading file and using Node:
```
node script.js
```
